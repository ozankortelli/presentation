  <h1>BTK AKADEMİ</h1>
  <p>I have completed two courses from this site and progressed halfway through a course. The first course I finished was "Web Development with HTML5" given by Fahrettin Erdinç. In this course, I learned what HTML, CSS, JS are and how to use them.Afterwards, I progressed from the "Web Programming with REACT" course prepared by Engin Demiroğ and completed half of it. Lastly, "Atıl Samancıoğlu" prepared
    I completed the "Version Controls: Git and GitHub" course and got my certificate.</p>

  <h1>UDEMY</h1>
  <p>The most difficult issue while continuing the training was not knowing how to progress after a certain level. To solve this problem, I watched many videos and read articles. I talked to people. For a while, I did some projects to improve my JavaScript skills with the videos I found on Youtube.
    After these videos, I realized that I was missing JavaScript. I found a comprehensive tutorial for Web Development from Udemy. I am currently continuing this training.</p>
